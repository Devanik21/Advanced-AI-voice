> Advanced AI Voice — digital signal processing for audio: filtering, feature extraction, and quality restoration.

**Topics:** `audio-ml` · `conversational-ai` · `deep-learning` · `generative-ai` · `natural-language-processing` · `neural-networks` · `neural-tts` · `speech-synthesis` · `text-to-speech` · `voice-ai`

## Overview

Advanced AI Voice applies digital signal processing techniques to audio signals, covering filter design, noise reduction, and spectral analysis. It provides both a programmatic API and an interactive interface for exploring audio processing parameters and observing their effects in real time.

The processing pipeline is built on SciPy's signal processing module and LibROSA, combining classical IIR/FIR filter theory with modern audio feature extraction. The project serves both as a practical audio processing tool and as an educational resource for understanding DSP concepts.

All processing steps are visualised with before/after waveform and spectrogram comparisons, and quantitative metrics (SNR, PESQ where applicable) provide objective quality measurement.

---

## Motivation

Audio quality issues — background noise, hum, clipping, reverb — affect recordings across speech, music, and scientific data. This project addresses these challenges with well-understood DSP techniques, providing transparent, configurable processing with measurable results.

## Features

### Filter Design
IIR and FIR filter design with configurable type, order, and cutoff frequency.

### Spectral Analysis
STFT, mel spectrogram, and MFCC feature extraction with visualisation.

### Noise Reduction
Multiple denoising methods: filtering, spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering.

### Quality Metrics
SNR before/after comparison, spectral flatness measurement.

### Waveform Visualisation
Before/after waveform and spectrogram comparison plots.

### Batch Processing
Process multiple audio files with the same configuration.

### Audio Playback Interface
In-app playback of original and processed audio for subjective evaluation.

### Export
Save processed audio in WAV, MP3, or FLAC format.
